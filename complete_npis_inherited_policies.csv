The stages are very slow and each lasts 3 weeks. Stage 1 automatically began on May 5th statewide. After that all counties must apply and meet thresholds in order to move to other stages. By 6/1/20 when the stay at home order expired and was not renewed many counties were in phase 2. I have indicated phase 2 in grey according to the ideal state timeline. Additionally in mid may the governor offered some bridge Phase 1 and Phase 2 categories for cetain counties. Additionally counties may apply for variance.
